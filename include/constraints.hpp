// Hopefully there are only two lines in this file that are specific
// to our scalar space being modulo the group order of Curve 25519,
// namely this include and the "using scalar" below. If ever we want to
// extend the context to other types of scalars, then maybe it can be
// done by having an abstract scalar type with specific implementations.
#include "scalar25519.hpp"

/* We manipulate two type sof constraints:
 *
 * 1. Linear constraints of the form
 * 
 *    sum_{i=1}^n x_{j_i} * a_{j_i} = b (mod P)
 * 
 * where the j_i's are the indexes, the x'es are the variables, and
 * the a's and b are the public coefficients. Such constraints are
 * represented by the scalar b and a map
 * 
 *   [ j_1->a_{j_1}, j_2->a_{j_2}, ..., j_n->a_{j_n} ]
 * 
 * with the (sorted, unique) indexes j_i in the range [1,N].
 * 
 * 2. Quadratic constraints of the form
 *
 *    sum_{i=1}^n x_{j_i} * y_{j_i} = b (mod P)
 * 
 * where the j_i's are the indexes and the x'es and y's are variables.
 * These constraints are represented by the scalar b and by the set
 * { j_1,...,j_n } of (sorted, unique) indexes j_i in the range [1,N].
 *
 *
 * For a linear constraint we will have an associated Pedersen vector
 * commitment
 * 
 *   C = base*r + \sum_{i=1}^n x_{j_i} * G_{j_i}.
 * 
 * For an inner-product constraint we will have two associated Pedersen
 * vector commitments
 * 
 *   C1 = base*r1 + \sum_{i=1}^n x_{j_i}*G_{j_i}
 *   C2 = base*r2 + \sum_{i=1}^n y_{j_i}*H_{j_i}
 *
 * (where we have the same set of indexes j_i for the x'es and y's.
 * These commitments are defined with respect to a public "canonical"
 * list of generators G_1,...,G_N, H_1,...,H_N.
 * 
 * The main way to manipulate these constraints is by aggregating them,
 * where linear constraints are aggregated by taking a random linear
 * combination of them and quadratic constraints on disjoint variables
 * are aggregated by concatenating them.
 * 
 * Once we have only one constraint of each type we can "move" all the
 * variables that appear in both to the quadratic constraint, resulting
 * in constraints that are almost disjoint on their sets of variables.
 * This transformation introduces one additional variable that appears
 * in both output constraints, hence only "almost disjoint".
 * 
 * Another transformation that we use is taking a quadratic constraint
 *   CNSTR = [ sum_{i=1}^n x_{j_i}*y_{j_i} = b (mod P) ],
 * and producing another constraint with the same indexes but different
 * variables and different scalar
 *   CNSTR' = [ sum_{i=1}^n x'_{j_i}*y'_{j_i} = b' (mod P) ].
 * This transformation has the property that knowledge of x',y' variables
 * satisfying CNSTR' implies also knowldge of x,y variables satisfying the
 * original CNSTR, which in addition satisfy x_{j_i}=y_{j_i} for all i.
